                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I like seeking opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. I graduated from Georgia College with a B.B.A in MIS in August 2018.
                Soon after I began work at Exela Technologies in a Systems Analyst role. During my time there I was exposed to engaging work, full of problem solving and planning.</p>
                <p>After much exposure to it, I wanted to learn programing in a more formal setting. In September 2019 I enrolled in Lambda school's full-stack developer program. Learning in a 100% remote environment allowed me to develop self-discipline regarding team-projects, and my personal reasearch and projects. </p>
